                1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent

                as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because
                "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we
                called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."

              <li>
